Dear Prime Minister,

After the recent events that triggered no-confidence vote, I was very worried about the country's leadership.

Deep in my mind I had strong believes that UK have strong prime minister, who is capable to execute well in unprecented conditions.

I am very delighted that you won the confidence vote, as I adore your ability to negotiate and get things done with very limited resources and tough conditions.

I wish you all the best in your mission to "make country which works for everyone".

As a European Union citizen who is living in UK, I want thank you for the clarification ahead of EU counterparts, that EU citizens can stay in UK in case of 'no-deal Brexit'.

I express my greatest support to your leadership.

Kind Regards,
Name Surname
