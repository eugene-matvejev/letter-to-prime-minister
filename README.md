software developer way to write support to British Prime Minister

Dear Prime Minister,

after recent events and triggered no-confidence vote, I was very worried about country leadership

deep in a mind I had strong believes that UK have strong prime minister, who is capable to execute well in unprecented conditions

I am very deliteful that you won no confidence vote, as I adore your ability to negotiate and get things done in with very limited resources and taught conditions

I wish you all the best in your mission to "make country which works for everyone"

as European Union citizen who is living in UK, I want thank you for clarification ahead of EU counterparts, that EU citizens can stay in UK in case of 'no-deal Brexit'

I express my greatest support to your leadership

Kind Regards,
Name Surname
